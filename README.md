## üöÄ Local Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18+)
* **npm** or **Yarn**
* **Google Gemini API Key** (Get one from Google AI Studio)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/faizscripts/my-open-ai.git
    cd my-open-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root and add your API key:

    ```
    # .env.local
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Run in Vercel Development Mode:**
    Since the project uses Vercel Serverless Functions for the API, you must use the Vercel CLI to run both the frontend and backend simultaneously:

    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```

    The application will typically start at `http://localhost:3000`.
